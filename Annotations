echo is a Bash builtin command that writes the arguments it receives to the standard output. It appends a
newline to the output, by default.


About bash variables:
It is important to note that $1 has to be quoted in double quote, not single quote. "$1" expands to the first
command line argument, as desired, while '$1' evaluates to literal string $1.

About Debug:
The -x argument enables you to walk through each line in the script. 
    Example: bash -x ( more on debug-mode.sh Chapter 1).

About Shebang(#!):
    #!/usr/bin/env bash
    the env path is only resolved when its a directly call, for example: my-script.sh
    the shebang is ignored when a specific interpreter is indicated, for example:
    sh my-script.sh
Command tips:
cd - : take you to the previous directory you were in, no matter where it was.   
cd ~ : let you in your home directory.
